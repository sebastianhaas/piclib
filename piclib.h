 * \brief Merges two uint8_t into a uint16_t.

 * that the given value is right-aligned. The parameter lowerBits will be the
 * first eight bits from the right, higherBits the last eight.
 * 
 * Example: Decimal 1000 is submitted as two uint8_t (0x03  and 0xE8).

 * \param lowerBits The lowerBitswer part of the submitted value
 * \param higherBits The higher part of the submitted value
 * \returns A uint16_t with the value of the two uint8_t parameters merged
